# Interactive-Exhibit-Final-Project
Items from designing the final project from HIS9832B including reference material, photos/videos of progress on the final model and basic 3D models made in sketch up.


Design for a small exhibit which a child could interact with.  Items made to be grabbed and pulled, which can be an issue with children in heritage or museum spaces.  Meant to simply show different spaces in Britain during WWII and the different activities which children engaged in to assist the war effort.  

By pulling on either the carrot or the rock, a sign is raised which depicts an activity children would have been involved with.  Designs are based on propaganda posters found in the Imperial War Museum Archive. Signposts are also mimicking contemporary designs.

Original plan was had three sections - urban, rural and the hedgerow - but space only allowed for two at this scale. With a third the mechanisms for the signs would not have fit properly.  The third section would have depicted a country road and the pull object would have been a wildflower.
