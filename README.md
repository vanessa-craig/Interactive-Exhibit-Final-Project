# Interactive-Exhibit-Final-Project
Items from designing the final project from HIS9832B including reference material, photos/videos of progress on the final model and basic 3D models made in sketch up.


The design was intended as a small exhibit which a child could interact with.  Items were made to be grabbed and pulled, which can be an issue with children in heritage or museum spaces.  The intent was to simply show different spaces in Britain during WWII and the different activities which children engaged in to assist the war effort.  

By pulling on either the carrot or the rock, a sign is raised which depicts an activity children would have been involved with.  The watercolour pictures are based on propaganda posters found in the Imperial War Museum Archive. Signposts are also mimicking contemporary designs.

THe original plan was had three sections - urban, rural and the hedgerow - but space only allowed for two at this scale. With a third the mechanisms for the signs would not have fit properly. In addition to the string pull mechanism, elastic cord was used so that the signs would drop back down when the string was released, this took up additional space.  

The third section would have depicted a country road and the pull object would have been a wildflower.  At a larger scale, ideally the rural section would have the object inset into the box, making it seem more like harvesting the vegetable out of the ground.

Materials used include watercolour and acrylic paint, cardboard, various string/twine, hot glue, various papers as well as natural items such as twigs and shrub brush.
